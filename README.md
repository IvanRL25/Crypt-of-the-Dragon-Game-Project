# Crypt of the Dragon

## A simple dungeon crawler game written Java

This project was my first attempt at making a text-based game using the Java that I knew in college.
As the project has grown many new features have been added such as: 
 * Class System has been emplemented that enables different stat distributions affecting how the game is played
 * A Leveling and Experience system that enables player growth as the game progresses
 * Pixel art based enemies that scale with game level
 * A functional Pause Menu
     * Allows players to see current stats
     * Raise stats if upgrade points are available
     * Return to main menu and restart the game
       
This project has been a great learning experience and I aim to continue adding new features in the future. Hope
you enjoy this game as much as I have.

## Future Planned Features
* Additional Enemies
* Save implementation
* Resistences and Weakness to certain attacks
